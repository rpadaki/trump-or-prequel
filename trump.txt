It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I!
You do know know, nor do you care, the great damage and hurt you have inflicted upon wonderful and loving members of my family.
You are the ones bringing pain and suffering to our Republic for your own selfish personal, political, and partisan gain.
You showed no remorse, no capacity for self-reflection.
You view democracy as your enemy!
You said it was very divisive — it certainly is, even far more than you ever thought possible — and it will only get worse!
This is nothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup...
No intelligent person believes what you are saying.
